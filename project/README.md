This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) application for generating custom student email addresses and determining their joining year based on their student number. Users can either manually input student data or upload a CSV file containing the data, and the program generates a new CSV file with the required information.



## **Features**

1. **Manual Data Input**  
   - Users can enter the **first name** and **student number** of students through the GUI.
   - Added data is stored in memory until the user generates the final CSV file.

2. **CSV File Upload**  
   - Allows uploading of a CSV file containing student data.
   - The input file must have the following columns:  
     - `name` (First Name)  
     - `sn` (Student Number)  

3. **Generate Output CSV**  
   - Combines manually entered data and uploaded CSV data.
   - Generates a CSV file with the following columns:  
     - `name`: Student's first name.  
     - `email`: A custom email in the format `{student_number}{name}@harvard.edu`.  
     - `year_joined`: The year derived from the first two digits of the student number (e.g., `23 â†’ 2023`).  

4. **User-Friendly Interface**  
   - Built with `tkinter` for ease of use.
   - Clear error messages and feedback for invalid actions.

## **How to Use**

### **1. Run the Program**
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, run the script:
```bash
python script_name.py
```
Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the Python file.

---

### **2. Input Methods**

#### **Manual Data Entry**
- In the "Manually Add Students" section:
  - Enter the **first name** and **student number**.
  - Click the **Add Student** button to add the data.
  - Repeat for additional students.

#### **CSV File Upload**
- In the "Upload CSV File" section:
  - Click the **Upload CSV** button.
  - Select a valid CSV file with the required columns:
    - `name`: First Name.  
    - `sn`: Student Number.  

---

### **3. Generate CSV File**
- Once all desired data is added (manually or via file upload):
  - Click the **Generate CSV** button in the "Generate CSV File" section.
  - Choose a location to save the output file.
  - The generated CSV will include:
    - `name`: First name.  
    - `email`: Custom email in the format `{student_number}{name}@harvard.edu`.  
    - `year_joined`: The joining year derived from the student number.

---

## **Input Requirements**

### **Manual Input**
- **Name**: Only the student's first name (letters only, no spaces or special characters).
- **Student Number**: A numeric identifier, e.g., `S2301`.

### **CSV File Format**
The input CSV file must include the following columns:
- `name`: The student's first name.
- `sn`: The student's number.

Example CSV File:
```csv
name,sn
John,S2301
Jane,S2402
```

---

## **Output CSV**
The generated CSV file includes:
- `name`: Student's first name.
- `email`: Custom email in the format `{student_number}{name}@harvard.edu`.
- `year_joined`: The year the student joined, derived from the first two digits of the student number.

Example Output:
```csv
name,email,year_joined
John,2301john@harvard.edu,2023
Jane,2402jane@harvard.edu,2024
```

## **Error Handling**

1. **Manual Input Errors**  
   - Both fields (**name** and **student number**) must be filled.  
   - An error message is displayed if either field is empty.

2. **CSV File Errors**  
   - The uploaded file must be a valid CSV with `name` and `sn` columns.  
   - If the file is invalid, an error message is displayed.

3. **No Data to Save**  
   - An error is displayed if the user attempts to generate the CSV without any data.

4. **File Writing Errors**  
   - If the program encounters an error while writing the output file, a detailed error message is displayed.
